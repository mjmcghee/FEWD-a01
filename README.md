FEWD assignment 1

## Intro
Yo! My name is **Marcus**. I've been taking classes at _**SDCCE**_ for a couple of years now. I've been taking courses at SDCCE since 2019 when the pandemic started. I needed something to keep me distracted while at home so I wouldn't go insane. I enjoy the classes, especially because they are free! I have an extreme view that is very anti for-profit education. I think the courses offered by SDCCD are among the best I've taken at any academic institution I've attended before in the past. I plan on continuing my education thourgh SDCCD as long as they continue to offer these excellent classes at no cost.
                
## Currently:
I work in San Diego as a commercial electrician with the IBEW. This wasn't the career path I would have expected to pursue when I was in my 20's, but after gaining experience in many other fields and figuring out what I didn't like or see as long term career prospects, I tried my hand as an electrical laborer. I guess it's true that you find what you're looking for in the last place you look. Nowadays I don't work on commercial sites. I now train and recruit the next generation of electrical workers.

Here's a list of my favorite type of noodles:
* Ramen
* Pho
* Soba
* Naengmyeong
